# Amwell Take-home Assessment

## Run 
Simply npm install and npm start can run the app.

## Time spent
It took about 1 hour for the MVP, which includes functions and basic styles. I spent about 30 more minutes trying out different CSS styles with blue colors afterward, but decided to go back to simple black and white styling and committed. 

## App
React and React hook were used for this Javascript app. I considered using separate components, but decided it was unnecessary for this simple app. CSS3 was used for styling on a separate spreadsheet. Amwell logo image was used for the app. 

## Data 
I used split, parseInt, filter, and sort for the data. I did consider parsing and saving the lowest 3 numbers in a single loop rather than using separate methods. However, after building numerous small apps and editing them, I came to prefer saving the data sets in usable manner. This way, if I need to skip parseInt, filter or any steps in between and make separate data set, I can easily manipulate the data. If the processing efficiency made a meaningful difference for the user experience, I would consider focusing on efficiency of data processing.
