# Amwell Take-home Assessment

## Run 
Simply npm install and npm start can run the app.

## Time spent
It took about 1 hour for the MVP, which includes functions and basic styles. I spent about 30 more minutes trying out different CSS styles with blue colors afterward, but decided to go back to simple black and white styling and committed. 

## App
React and React hook were used for this Javascript app. Considered using separate components, but decided it was unnecessary for this simple app. CSS3 was used for styling on a separate spreadsheet. Amwell logo image for the app.
